# Tree-Comparison
This project implements product code management using three tree-based data structures: a Binary Search Tree (BST), an AVL tree, and a Red-Black tree (std::set). The program reads operations from a file to add or remove 6-digit codes, supports in-order traversal for validation, and compares performance across implementations.
